### Command Line Tools

The package provides the following command-line tools:

- `flower-detector-build-dataset`: Build COCO format dataset with train/val/test splits
- `flower-detector-train`: Train Mask R-CNN model with CPU optimizations
- `flower-detector-mine-negatives`: Automated hard negative mining
- `flower-detector-verify`: Launch Streamlit verification UI

### Configuration Integration

All components are configured through a single `config.yaml` file with sections for:

- **Data paths**: Google Drive integration and local storage
- **Training parameters**: CPU-optimized batch sizes, learning rates, epochs
- **Model architecture**: Mask R-CNN configuration following He et al. (2017)
- **Hard negative mining**: Confidence thresholds and convergence criteria
- **Hardware optimization**: Intel Core Ultra 7 specific optimizations
- **UI settings**: Streamlit interface customization

### Research Foundation

This implementation establishes the foundational methodology for:

1. **High-precision object detection** in scientific applications
2. **Human-in-the-loop machine learning** for systematic bias reduction
3. **CPU-optimized deep learning** for resource-constrained environments
4. **Reproducible scientific computing** with deterministic workflows

The system serves as a proof of concept that generic object detection models can achieve scientific-grade precision through systematic hard negative mining and human verification workflows.

### Known Limitations
